This is the first post of this hybrid project. Hybrid because it will be part coding, part thoughts. 

It has been interesting creating a website from scratch. At first I thought of only using HTML and CSS, but then my imagination ran rampant and wanted to include many of things. 

I've dabbled in React for a bit as I wanted to create a website just from a React Application, but things are not as easy as they seem at first. I started to need other components to the website, like this blog, that the intended application was not able to give me. 

As I started using Gatsby, the progress on the website became exponentially easier.

 I will keep updating this blog, and the website. Maybe in the future it will have a backdoor into a totally different website. Who knows...
