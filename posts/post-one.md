This is the first post of this project.

It has been interesting and challengingly creating a website from scratch. At first I thought of only using HTML and CSS, but then my imagination ran rampant and I wanted to include as many ideas into it as possible. 

I've dabbled in React for a bit before, as I wanted to create a website just from a React Application, but things are not as easy as they seem at first. At first I needed other components to the website, like this blog, that the intended application was not able to give me. 

As I started using Gatsby, the progress on the website became exponentially easier.

 I will keep updating this blog, and the website. Maybe in the future it will have a backdoor into a totally different website. Who knows...
