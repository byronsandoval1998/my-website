I'm making a big update.
I started this project using Gatsby which was helpful, but it wasn't customizable enough. It had a lot of problems. I couldn't add a navbar, sections, and when updating the project it would break.

I chose to start over. I change everything, even the framework. I'm working now with Next JS and TailwindCSS. It has made my life easier, not without its faults (I will be expanding on these at a later post).

For now I'm happy, this is a second try...
