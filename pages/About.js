              My name is Byron. Nice to meet you. I write code and fiction. 
              I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science and Information Security, 
              as well as a B.A. in Spanish Literature. I graduated right when the pandemic hit, so I decided
              to take the oportunity to enter a Master of Fine Arts program for Spanish Creative Writing. Now,
              after finishing the program, I came back to Software Development with the goal of making 
              problem-solving and thought-provoking applications. I will be adding both thinking and technical pieces in this website.
